https://app.muslimummah.co/post_detail?card_type=7&card_id=105&lang=en
does not create a copy of the original bitmap
does not use a clipPath which is not hardware accelerated and not anti-aliased.
does not use setXfermode to clip the bitmap and draw twice to the canvas.
If you know of a better method, let me know (or even better open a pull request)!
